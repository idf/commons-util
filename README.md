commons-util
============

Common functions for Java.  
Life is short; don't repeat yourself.  

# Langauge Level
Java 8 required

# Parallel Stream
Performance comparisons between Iteration, Stream, ParallelStream can be found in [Java 8 in Action](http://www.manning.com/urma/) Chapter 7. The bottom line is: choose the right data structure. 

# Methods
Public methods are supposed to be directly called since they are for repeating patterns solved multiple lines.  
Private methods are supposed to be an example to guide you to write the code rather than to be called since they are for repeating patterns solved in a single line.
